    "## Theorems\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: For each notation we indicate that $f(n)$ *equals* the notation, instead of belonging in it. While this is informal, it is used for ease of notation. Additionally, when a notation is used in an expression, it is used as a placeholder for a function belonging to that notation.\\\n",
    "For example, $1 + x + O(x^2)$  indicates $1 + x + f(x)$ where $f(x) \\in O(x^2)$. We expect for these to always present on the right hand side of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we get notations on the left hand side of the equation as well, e.g. $2 n^2 + O(n) = O(n^2)$, that means that for any function for the left hand side notation we can find a function for the right hand side within the notation such that it satisfies the equation. For example, if we pick $2n + 1$ on the left hand side, we can pick $n^2 + 2n + 1$ on the right hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asymptotic Notations Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem**: For any two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, we have $f(n) = \\Theta(g(n))$ if and only if $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $f(n) = \\Omega(g(n))$.\\\n",
    "**Proof**: The forwards direction follows directly from the definitions. For the backward direction pick $n_0$ for $\\Theta$ maximum between the $n_0$ for $O$ and for $\\Omega$. Then the constants given by the definitions for $\\Omega$ and $O$ also satisfy the definition for $\\Theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "1. $f(n) = \\Theta(g(n))$ and $g(n) = \\Theta(h(n))$ implies $f(n) = \\Theta(h(n))$\n",
    "2. $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $g(n) = O(h(n))$ implies $f(n) = O(h(n))$\n",
    "3. $f(n) = \\Omega(g(n))$ and $g(n) = \\Omega(h(n))$ implies $f(n) = \\Omega(h(n))$\n",
    "4. $f(n) = o(g(n))$ and $g(n) = o(h(n))$ implies $f(n) = o(h(n))$\n",
    "5. $f(n) = \\omega(g(n))$ and $g(n) = \\omega(h(n))$ implies $f(n) = \\omega(h(n))$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflexivity\n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "1. $f(n) = \\Theta(f(n))$\n",
    "2. $f(n) = O(f(n))$\n",
    "3. $f(n) = \\Omega(f(n))$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(n) = \\Theta(g(n))$ if and only if $g(n) = \\Theta(f(n))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transpose symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "$f(n) = O(g(n))$ if and only if $g(n) = \\Gamma(f(n))$\n",
    "$f(n) = o(g(n))$ if and only if $g(n) = \\gamma(f(n))$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Asymptotical ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "One can thing of asymptotic notation like ordering:\n",
    "- $f(n) = O(g(n))$ is like $a \\leq b$\n",
    "- $f(n) = \\Omega(g(n))$ is like $a \\geq b$\n",
    "- $f(n) = \\Theta(g(n))$ is like $a = b$\n",
    "- $f(n) = o(g(n))$ is like $a < b$\n",
    "- $f(n) = \\omega(g(n))$ is like $a > b$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we state that $f(n)$ is **asymptotically smaller** than $g(n)$ if $f(n) = o(g(n))$, and $f(n)$ is **asymptotically larger** than $g(n)$ if $f(n) = \\omega(g(n))$.\n",
    "Note that the **trichotomy** principle does not apply to asymptotic comparison - an example are $n$ and $n^{1 + sin(n)}$, since the latter's exponent oscillates between $0$ and $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maximum\n",
    "\n",
    "We have that $max\\{f(n), g(n)\\} = \\Theta(f(n) + g(n))$ for $f(n), g(n)$ asymptotically non-negative functions.\\\n",
    "**Proof**: By asymptotically non-negative, we can assume that $f(n), g(n)$ are non-negative for $n > n_0$. Then $f(n) + g(n) >= $ for $n > n_0$, so $max\\{f(n), g(n)\\} = O(f(n) + g(n))$. We also trivially have $f(n) + g(n) <= 2 max\\{f(n), g(n)\\}$, so $max\\{f(n), g(n)\\} = \\Omega(f(n) + g(n))$. By the *Asymptotic Notations Theorem*, the result follows."
