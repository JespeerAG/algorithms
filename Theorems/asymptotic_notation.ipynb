    "*Note*: For each notation we indicate that $f(n)$ *equals* the notation, instead of belonging in it. While this is informal, it is used for ease of notation. Additionally, when a notation is used in an expression, it is used as a placeholder for a function belonging to that notation.\\\n",
    "For example, $1 + x + O(x^2)$  indicates $1 + x + f(x)$ where $f(x) \\in O(x^2)$. We expect for these to always present on the right hand side of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we get notations on the left hand side of the equation as well, e.g. $2 n^2 + O(n) = O(n^2)$, that means that we can always pick a function for the right hand side notation such that  \n",

    "### Asymptotic Notations Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem**: For any two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, we have $f(n) = \\Theta(g(n))$ if and only if $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $f(n) = \\Omega(g(n))$.\\\n",
    "**Proof**: The forwards direction follows directly from the definitions. For the backward direction pick $n_0$ for $\\Theta$ maximum between the $n_0$ for $O$ and for $\\Omega$. Then the constants given by the definitions for $\\Omega$ and $O$ also satisfy the definition for $\\Theta$."
