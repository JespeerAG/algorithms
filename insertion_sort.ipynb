    "> *Invariant Claim*: The elements of `array[0:i]` are sorted in increasing order at the beginning of the $i^{th}$ loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ be `len(array)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization**: At the beginning, `i = 1` and `array[0:1] = [array[0]]` is a one-element array, so it is vacuously sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance**: Suppose that at the beginning of the $i^{th}$ loop, `array[0:i]` is sorted, and consider `key = array[i]`. Let `k` be the smallest element such that `key` is smaller than all the elements of `array[k:i]`. Due to ordering, this implies that `key` is greater than all the elements of `array[0:k]`.\\\n",
    "If `key` is smaller than all elements of `array[k:i]`, the `array[j] > key` condition remains true during the iteration of the `while` loop's iterator `j` from `i - 1` to `k` (inclusive). The `array[j + 1] = array[j]` line results in rotating `array[k:i]` right by one space, and `array[k] = key` sets `key` in an ordered spot, since it is greater than all the elements preceding it (`array[0:k]`) and by construction smaller than all the elements succeeding it (`array[k+1:i+1]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Termination**: The algorithm terminates with $i = n$. By invariant claim, `array[0:n]` is sorted, but this equals `array` by definition."

    "\n",
    "In the worst case, the initial array is in decreasing order. Then, for each outer `for` loop, we need to cycle through until the end to find the smallest card. The outer `for` loop is repeated for `n` times, hence the inner `while` loop will be repeated `n-1` times. This yields a performance of $\\Theta(n^2)$."
